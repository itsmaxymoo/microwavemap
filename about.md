# The Story

I'm Max, a Computer Science student (check my [site](https://itsmaxymoo.com))
at Penn State! I made this map because I believe everyone should be able to study
near a microwave.

# Adding a Microwave

To add a microwave, hit the [add]({{ site.baseurl }}/add) button up top
and follow the instructions. There are some simple rules for a new microwave:

* It must be accessible by students
* It may not be in a private residence (dorm, etc...)
* It must be in a relatively public area (ex: NOT a janitor's closet).
